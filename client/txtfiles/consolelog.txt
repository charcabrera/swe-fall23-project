* these are messages received by the player.
[These are comments made by Daniel describing what happens in-game.]
________________________________________________

[In the middle of the screen, there is a tiny glowing dot.]

* this is your universe. it’s in a hot, dense state right now. click to begin.

[Upon clicking: the dot explodes into a mass of white circular swirls.]

* things have cooled down a bit, but now there are particles scattered everywhere. click the universe to clump them into protons, neutrons, and electrons. 

[Every time the player clicks the universe, a random particle (proton, neutron, or electron) is added to their "bank."]

* once you’ve gathered enough particles, you can form them into an atom!
* with all that energy concentrated into a point, the surrounding area cools down, and new particles will start forming on their own. (slowly.)

[The player purchases an atom from the store. Now a slow stream of random particles gets added to their bank even while idling.]

* combine atoms to form molecules! these are even denser than atoms and will generate even more particles for you.

[The player buys more atoms and eventually purchases a molecule from the store. Their number of atoms decreases, but they receive a molecule in return. They now have an even larger rate of idle particle generation.]

* combine enough molecules to form a molecular cloud! you get the idea.

[etc.]

* combine enough molecular clouds to form a star! this is our first big leap. the rate of particle formation should increase greatly now.

* (hint: once you unlock a new item, you’ll also unlock trivia and fun facts about that item! this can be toggled in settings.)

[This is similar to the funny messages you receive while playing Trimps, except educational.]

* now that we have stars, try forming some molecular clouds into protoplanetary disks.

* combine a protoplanetary disk with some additional mass to get a planet!

* combine stars and planets to form a stable solar system! maybe one of these planets could support life someday...

* add some additional mass to a star to collapse it into a black hole. (if you're lucky, you might create a neutron star or quasi-star!)

[Neutron star = 10% chance. Quasi-star = 1% chance.
I haven't created artwork for neutron stars or quasi-stars yet. For simplicity's sake, let's just give the player bonus particles if this happens.]

* when several solar systems orbit a black hole, they form a galaxy! try it now.

* now that you've made it this far, you can RESET the whole universe with a Big Bounce. all of your counters are returned to zero, but they'll generate new particles much faster than before! (the total points earned by your account are always saved between resets, so you keep your spot on the leaderboard!)

* that's all for now. have fun playing God!
